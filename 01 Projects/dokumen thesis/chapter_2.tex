\chapter{REVIEW OF LITERATURE AND STUDIES} \label{cap:chapter2}

This chapter starts with a brief introductory paragraph concerning the researcherâ€™s exploration of related literature and studies on the research problem. It should be organized thematically to confirm to the specific problems. It should synthesize evidence from all studies reviewed to get an overall understanding of the state of the knowledge in the problem area. As much as possible, the reviewed should be limited within the last ten years. A statement showing how the related materials had assisted the researchers in the present study should be the last part.
